Create AI generated memes using MCP Meme Sticky. Can converted generated memes into stickers for Telegram or WhatsApp (WA coming soon). âœ¨ no APIs required âœ¨. 

For Telegram, the MCP server produces a link that can produce the image as a sticker. Can be viewed here: <a href="https://github.com/nkapila6/mcp-sticky-tele">MCP-Sticky Telegram Bot</a>.

## Attribution
The MCP server uses several services. Thank you to the following services / libraries.
- [Memegen](https://memegen.link/): GOATED open source meme generator!
- [PythonAnywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/): For their free Python clouds service! It powers the [Telegram bot](https://github.com/nkapila6/mcp-sticky-tele).
- [icrawler](https://github.com/hellock/icrawler): My image crawler is heavily inspired by their library.
- [FastMCP](https://gofastmcp.com/getting-started/welcome): FastMCP makes it easier to make Python MCP servers!

## Completed work

  - [x] Can generate Telegram link to convert image to sticker using custom coded <a href="https://github.com/nkapila6/mcp-sticky-tele">MCP-Sticky Telegram Bot</a>.
